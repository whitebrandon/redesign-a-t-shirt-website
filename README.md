# Redesign a T-Shirt Website

## Project Overview
You have been tasked with critiquing shirtsbymike.com, an e-commerce website that sells t-shirts. Your client wants to know if anything should be changed to make the site look and/or function better for their customers. You will need to describe the design elements you see on the site and determine what improvements need to be made. Explain each improvement so your client understands how it will benefit their customers.

#### NOTE: Getting an "Exceed Expectations" grade.

See the rubric in the "How You'll Be Graded" tab above for details on what you need to receive an "Exceed Expectations" grade.  
Passing grades are final. If you try for the "Exceeds Expectations" grade, but miss an item and receive a “Meets Expectations” grade, you won’t get a second chance. Exceptions can be made for items that have been misgraded in review.  
Always mention in the comments of your submission or any resubmission, what grade you are going for. Some students want their project to be rejected if they do not meet all Exceeds Expectations Requirements, others will try for all the "exceeds" requirement but do not mind if they pass with a Meets Expectations grade. Leaving a comment in your submission will help the reviewer understand which grade you are specifically going for.
